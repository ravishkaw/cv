          I am currently an undergraduate student University of Colombo Schoolof Computing. I am passionate about
          software development and quality assurance, and I am constantly working on improving my skills in these areas.
          I am a self-starter and take a proactive approach to learning, often teaching myself new programming languages
          and technologies in my free time. I am committed to always giving my best effort. I am excited to continue
          learning and growing as a programmer, and I am looking forward to seeing where my career in the field will
          take me.
